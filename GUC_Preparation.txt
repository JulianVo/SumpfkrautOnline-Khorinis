before compilation
---------------------

- Visal Studio Express 2013 or higher (compability issues)

- update projects to the current Visual Studio Express version standard

- add necessary Reference Path(s) of the dll-files (Mono.Data.Sqlite.dll, RakNet.dll, RakNetSwig.dll, sqlite3.dll) to each individual project (e.g. put all of them in one folder and reference the folder)

- set up Dependencies for each project of the solution (could be cleaner organized but works):
    * GMP_Server: Gothic, GUC
    * GMPStarter: GMP_Server, Gothic, GUC, WinApi
    * Gothic: WinApi
    * GUC: Gothic, WinApi
    * NetInject: /
    * Network: GMPStarter
    * ServerScripts: GMP_Server
    * WinApi: /
        --> results in the following Build Order: WinApi, Gothic, GUC, GMP_Server, GMPStarter, Network, NetInject, ServerScripts

- delete SumpfkrautOnline-Khorinis\Network\Properties\Assembly.cs if existent

- click on the Solution in Solution Explorer -> BUILD (tab) -> Configuration Manager -> exclude Network-project from Build (its code will be used by other projects though)
    --> make sure everything else is checked for the build (you might want to exclude NetInject too)
    
- necessary to compile a playable version in >>Release-mode<<:
    - for each project: project Properties -> Build (tab) -> set all
    Conditional compilation symbols as in Debug-mode
    (e.g. ServerScripts: set to SSM_ACCOUNT;SSM_ACCOUNT_LOGGING;SSM_WEB;SSM_AI;SSM_CHAT)
    -> this is done for 3 projects setting the following symbols:
        (project: symbols)
        * GMP_SERVER: D_SERVER
        * GUC: D_CLIENT
        * ServerScripts: SSM_ACCOUNT;SSM_ACCOUNT_LOGGING;SSM_WEB;SSM_AI;SSM_CHAT

# for MySql (ignore - not used yet)
- download and install MySql Connector if necessary and add reference to projects (if used there)



after compilation
-------------------


- copy NetInject-build from GUC\SumpfkrautOnline-Khorinis\Release\
 into B:\Games\Gothic2\System\UntoldChapter\DLL manually

- copy RakNet.dll into <Gothic2-Directory>\System\UntoldChapter\DLL and <Gothic2-Ordner>\System\UntoldChapter\Server

- copy Mono.Data.Sqlite.dll and sqlite3.dll into <Gothic2-Directoy>\System\UntoldChapter\Server

# fix to spawn into the world with no Accountsystem (ignore)
- add the following to the Startup-Class of the Serverscripts:
in OnServerInit-method:
    Player.sOnPlayerConnects += new Events.PlayerEventHandler(test);

in class-body:
    public void test(Player sender)
    {
        sender.Spawn("NEWWORLD\\NEWWORLD.ZEN", new Vec3f(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f), new Vec3f(0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f));
    }
